                    Recruiters understand how many pieces of a puzzle need to be brought together in order to make a
                    hire. They also understand that the most difficult piece of the puzzle is something out of their
                    control - finding a candidate who’s both qualified for the job and is ready to make a career move.
                    Recruitment professionals often call candidates off of one list, hoping to get a hold of just one of
                    the individuals they have pre-qualified for the job for which they’re sourcing. Not only do most
                    people not answer their phones or read emails, but these candidate source lists are often
                    overworked, and the potential candidates are tired of being offered a job when they aren’t currently
                    realizing limitations within their current roles.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    So what happens when recruiters who were tired of the old process mesh with experts in big data,
                    artificial intelligence and advanced algorithmic matching?
